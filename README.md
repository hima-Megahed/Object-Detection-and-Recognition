# Object Detection & Recognition

This project was intended to demonstrate machine learning skills through applying the most basic ML algorithms to eventually detect and     recognize predefined objects.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes

### Prerequisites
There are some modules you need to install first so you can be able to run the projects and the automated tests
for example:
```
Anaconda
```
```
Python 3.6
```
```
OpenCV
```
```
Matplotlib
```
```
Plotly
```
```
scikit-learn
```

### Installing
In case of mine I used Virtual env created using anaconda then installed all needed module
P.S > Development IDE was Pycharm professional 2017

## Built With

* [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) - Used to generate PCs Graph
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - PCA Algorithm
* [OpenCV](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) - Used to segment testing images
